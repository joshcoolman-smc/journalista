# AI Progress Tracking

This folder contains feature documents and project specifications for collaborative development between Josh and Claude.

## Folder Structure

### `open/`
Contains feature documents that are:
- Currently being planned or developed
- Ready for implementation
- In progress

### `closed/`
Contains completed feature documents that have been:
- Fully implemented
- Tested and verified
- Moved here for historical reference

## Document Status Convention

Each document should include a status line near the top:
- **Status: Planning** - Still being refined and discussed
- **Status: Ready for Implementation** - Specification complete, ready to code
- **Status: In Progress** - Currently being implemented
- **Status: Completed** - Implementation finished, ready to move to `closed/`

## Workflow

1. **Planning**: Create or refine feature documents in `open/`
2. **Implementation**: Use documents in `open/` as specifications
3. **Completion**: Move finished documents to `closed/`
4. **Reference**: Use `closed/` documents for historical context and maintenance

This simple system provides clear project management without tool overhead while keeping everything version-controlled with the codebase.
