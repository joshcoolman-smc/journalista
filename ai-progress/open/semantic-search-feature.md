# Semantic Search Feature - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing intelligent semantic search capabilities in the journalista application. The feature will enable users to search across journal entries using natural language queries, finding relevant content based on meaning and context rather than just keyword matching.

## Problem Statement

Current journal applications rely on basic keyword search, which has significant limitations:
- Users must remember exact words or phrases used in entries
- Conceptually related content is missed if different terminology is used
- No understanding of context, synonyms, or semantic relationships
- Difficulty finding entries when users remember the concept but not specific words
- Limited ability to discover connections between entries

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
1. **As a journal user**, I want to search for "documents about work stress" and find entries mentioning burnout, workplace pressure, or job anxiety, even if they don't contain the exact phrase "work stress"
2. **As a researcher**, I want to find all entries related to "personal growth" and discover content about self-improvement, mindfulness, learning, and development
3. **As a reflective writer**, I want to search for "relationship challenges" and find entries about conflicts, communication issues, or emotional struggles with others
4. **As a knowledge worker**, I want to quickly find entries containing ideas related to my current project, even if I used different terminology when writing them

### Secondary User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want search suggestions to appear as I type to help refine my query
2. **As a user**, I want to see relevant snippets from matching entries to understand why they were selected
3. **As a user**, I want to filter search results by date range or other metadata
4. **As a user**, I want to save frequent searches for easy access

## Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality

#### 1. Semantic Search Engine
- **Vector Embeddings**: Convert all journal entries into high-dimensional vector representations
- **Query Processing**: Transform user queries into the same vector space for similarity comparison
- **Relevance Scoring**: Rank results by semantic similarity with configurable thresholds
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically re-index entries when created, modified, or deleted

#### 2. Search Interface
- **Quick Access**: Keyboard shortcut (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K) to open search modal
- **Instant Search**: Real-time results as user types (debounced)
- **Result Previews**: Show relevant snippets with highlighted context
- **Advanced Filters**: Date range, content length, tags (if implemented)
- **Search History**: Recent queries for quick re-access

#### 3. Result Presentation
- **Relevance Ranking**: Results sorted by semantic similarity score
- **Context Snippets**: Show 1-2 sentences around relevant content
- **Highlighted Keywords**: Emphasize matching concepts in previews
- **Quick Actions**: Open, preview, or bookmark results directly from search

### Technical Architecture

#### Option A: Client-Side Implementation (Privacy-First)
**Pros:**

**Technical Stack:**
- **Embedding API**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large or Cohere Embed
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone, Weaviate, or Supabase Vector
- **Search Infrastructure**: Optimized similarity search with filtering
- **Caching**: Local result caching for performance

#### Option C: Hybrid Architecture (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Balances privacy, performance, and capability
- Graceful degradation when offline
- Cost-effective for most use cases
- Scalable architecture

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Local Caching**: Store embeddings locally after cloud processing
- **Smart Syncing**: Only re-process modified entries
- **Fallback Search**: Basic keyword search when semantic search unavailable
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic search, upgrade to semantic

### Data Architecture

#### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **Text Extraction**: Clean markdown content, remove formatting
2. **Chunking**: Split long entries into semantic chunks (paragraphs/sections)
3. **Embedding Generation**: Convert text to vectors using chosen model
4. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract dates, tags, word counts, etc.
5. **Index Storage**: Store vectors with metadata for fast retrieval

#### Vector Database Schema
```typescript
interface DocumentChunk {
  id: string;
  journalEntryId: string;
  content: string;
  embedding: number[];
  metadata: {
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
    chunkIndex: number;
    wordCount: number;
    tags?: string[];
  };
}

interface SearchResult {
  chunk: DocumentChunk;
  similarity: number;
  relevantSnippet: string;
  highlightedContent: string;
}
```
